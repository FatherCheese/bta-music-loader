# BTA Music Loader

This allows you to load music through texture packs!

**Note: *If the pack is in a .zip format, it will unzip the entire pack in a temp folder!***


## Prerequisites

- Minecraft BTA 7.2 pre2


## Usage instructions for texture pack creators

- Create a new folder in your texture pack called `music`.
- Drag and drop any music with the supported formats; `.ogg`, `.wav`, and `.mp3` into the folder.
- It should now replace the music sound pool with your songs!
